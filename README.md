Defining the Problem Statement:
Data on every Operating System is stored in a hierarchical file system constituted of directories and subdirectories beneath them. A file management system is the program used to arrange these files, move them, and create / delete them. This take care of how the files are organized rather than how they are stored.

Create, modify, move, copy, delete and other file operations.
